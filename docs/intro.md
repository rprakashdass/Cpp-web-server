# Introduction

This project is a lightweight, high-performance C++ application framework (POSIX standard) for building web servers, static sites, REST/RPC APIs, and even desktop/mobile-like runtimes. It is inspired by Express, designed for extensibility, and built for modern C++ developers who want both speed and flexibility.

## Why Use This Framework?
- Blazing fast and scalable
- Clean, modular architecture
- Easy to extend and integrate
- Cross-platform ambitions (web, desktop, mobile)
- POSIX-compliant for portability
